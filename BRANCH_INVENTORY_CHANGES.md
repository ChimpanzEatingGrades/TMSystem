# Branch-Based Inventory System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The inventory system has been restructured to support **branch-based inventory tracking**. Each raw material can now have different quantities at different branches, instead of a single global quantity.

## New Structure

### Raw Material
- **Name**: Material name
- **UOM (Unit of Measurement)**: e.g., "kg", "liters", "pieces"
- **Low threshold**: Minimum quantity before alert (per branch)
- **Expiry/Shelf life**: Days until material expires
- **Material Type**: raw, processed, semi-processed, or supplies
- **Branch Quantities**: FK relationship (one-to-many)

### Branch Quantity
- **FK: Branch**: Which branch this quantity belongs to
- **FK: Raw Material**: Which material this is tracking
- **Quantity**: Current stock at this branch
- **Timestamps**: created_at, updated_at

Every raw material now has a `BranchQuantity` record for each branch where it's stocked.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Models (`inventory/models.py`)

#### RawMaterial Model
- ‚úÖ **Removed**: `quantity` field (global quantity)
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Methods to get quantities:
  - `get_total_quantity()` - Sum across all branches
  - `get_quantity_for_branch(branch)` - Get quantity for specific branch
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: Threshold help texts now mention "per branch"

#### BranchQuantity Model (NEW)
- ‚úÖ **Created**: New model to track quantities per branch
- Fields: `branch`, `raw_material`, `quantity`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Properties: `is_low_stock`, `needs_reorder`
- Unique constraint: `(branch, raw_material)` pair

#### PurchaseOrder Model
- ‚úÖ **Added**: `branch` field to track which branch the purchase is for
- This ensures inventory is added to the correct branch

---

### 2. Serializers (`inventory/serializers.py`)

#### BranchQuantitySerializer (NEW)
```python
fields = [
    "id", "branch", "branch_name", "raw_material", "raw_material_name",
    "raw_material_unit", "quantity", "is_low_stock", "needs_reorder",
    "created_at", "updated_at"
]
```

#### RawMaterialSerializer
- ‚úÖ **Removed**: `quantity`, `is_low_stock`, `needs_reorder` fields
- ‚úÖ **Added**: 
  - `branch_quantities` - nested serializer showing all branch quantities
  - `total_quantity` - computed field summing all branches

#### PurchaseOrderCreateSerializer
- ‚úÖ **Added**: `branch` field (required)
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: `update_inventory()` method now:
  - Requires a branch to be specified
  - Creates/updates `BranchQuantity` for the specified branch
  - Adds inventory to the correct branch

#### CustomerOrderCreateSerializer
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: `update_inventory()` method now:
  - Requires order to have a branch
  - Deducts inventory from the order's branch only
  - Validates stock availability per branch

#### StockOutSerializer
- ‚úÖ **Added**: `branch_id` field to specify which branch to stock out from

---

### 3. Views (`inventory/views.py`)

#### BranchQuantityViewSet (NEW)
```python
# Endpoints:
GET    /api/branch-quantities/           # List all branch quantities
GET    /api/branch-quantities/{id}/      # Get specific branch quantity
POST   /api/branch-quantities/           # Create branch quantity
PUT    /api/branch-quantities/{id}/      # Update branch quantity
DELETE /api/branch-quantities/{id}/      # Delete branch quantity

# Custom actions:
GET    /api/branch-quantities/by_branch/?branch_id={id}  # Get all for a branch
GET    /api/branch-quantities/low_stock/                  # Get low stock items
```

#### RawMaterialViewSet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Some methods referencing `material.quantity` need updating
- Alert methods will need to be adapted for branch-specific alerts

#### StockOutViewSet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Needs updating to work with branch quantities

---

### 4. URL Routing (`inventory/urls.py`)

‚úÖ **Added**: `router.register(r'branch-quantities', BranchQuantityViewSet, basename='branch-quantity')`

---

### 5. Database Migration

**File**: `migrations/0024_branch_based_inventory.py`

**Operations**:
1. Add `branch` field to `PurchaseOrder`
2. Create `BranchQuantity` model
3. Add unique constraint on `(branch, raw_material)`
4. **Remove `quantity` field from `RawMaterial`**
5. Update help text for threshold fields

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Before running this migration, you may want to create a data migration to transfer existing quantities to branch quantities.

---

## Migration Steps

### Option 1: Fresh Database (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Delete existing database
python manage.py migrate inventory zero

# Run all migrations including the new one
python manage.py migrate
```

### Option 2: Preserve Existing Data
Before running the migration, you'll need to:

1. **Create a default branch** if one doesn't exist:
```python
from inventory.models import Branch
Branch.objects.get_or_create(name='Main Branch')
```

2. **Create a data migration** to copy existing quantities to BranchQuantity:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations --empty inventory
```

Then edit the migration file to add:
```python
def migrate_quantities_to_branches(apps, schema_editor):
    RawMaterial = apps.get_model('inventory', 'RawMaterial')
    Branch = apps.get_model('inventory', 'Branch')
    BranchQuantity = apps.get_model('inventory', 'BranchQuantity')
    
    # Get or create main branch
    main_branch, _ = Branch.objects.get_or_create(name='Main Branch')
    
    # Migrate all quantities
    for material in RawMaterial.objects.all():
        if hasattr(material, 'quantity') and material.quantity > 0:
            BranchQuantity.objects.create(
                branch=main_branch,
                raw_material=material,
                quantity=material.quantity
            )
```

3. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Create Purchase Order (with branch)
```json
POST /api/purchase-orders/
{
  "purchase_date": "2024-10-26",
  "branch": 1,  // Required: Branch ID
  "notes": "Weekly stock",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Chicken",
      "unit": 1,
      "quantity": 50,
      "unit_price": 150,
      "shelf_life_days": 7,
      "material_type": "raw"
    }
  ]
}
```
This will add 50 kg of chicken to Branch #1's inventory.

### 2. View Raw Material with Branch Quantities
```json
GET /api/rawmaterials/1/
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Chicken",
  "unit": "kg",
  "material_type": "raw",
  "total_quantity": 150,  // Sum across all branches
  "branch_quantities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "branch": 1,
      "branch_name": "Main Branch",
      "quantity": 100,
      "is_low_stock": false
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "branch": 2,
      "branch_name": "Branch 2",
      "quantity": 50,
      "is_low_stock": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. View Branch Inventory
```json
GET /api/branch-quantities/by_branch/?branch_id=1
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "branch": 1,
    "branch_name": "Main Branch",
    "raw_material": 1,
    "raw_material_name": "Chicken",
    "raw_material_unit": "kg",
    "quantity": 100,
    "is_low_stock": false,
    "needs_reorder": false
  },
  // ... more items
]
```

### 4. Create Customer Order (branch-specific)
```json
POST /api/customer-orders/
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "branch": 1,  // Order from this branch
  "items": [
    {
      "menu_item": 5,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}
```
This will deduct ingredients from Branch #1's inventory only.

### 5. Stock Out (branch-specific)
```json
POST /api/stock-out/stock_out/
{
  "raw_material_id": 1,
  "branch_id": 1,  // Stock out from this branch
  "quantity": 10,
  "notes": "Used for catering",
  "force_expired": false
}
```

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
1. **PurchaseOrder**: Now requires `branch` field
2. **CustomerOrder**: Must have a `branch` to process
3. **StockOut**: Must specify `branch_id`
4. **RawMaterial**: No longer has `quantity` field - use `get_total_quantity()` or `branch_quantities`

### üîß Needs Additional Updates
Some view methods still reference `material.quantity` and need to be updated:
- `RawMaterialViewSet.check_and_create_alerts()` - should check per branch
- `RawMaterialViewSet.low_stock_items()` - should use BranchQuantity
- `StockOutViewSet.stock_out()` - needs branch-based logic
- Alert system - should be branch-aware

### ‚úÖ Benefits
1. **Multi-branch support**: Each branch tracks its own inventory
2. **Better control**: Know exactly what's available at each location
3. **Accurate orders**: Orders only use inventory from their branch
4. **Branch transfers**: Can implement stock transfers between branches
5. **Branch-specific alerts**: Low stock alerts per branch

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run migrations
2. ‚úÖ Create initial branches
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update alert system for branch-specific alerts
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update StockOut to work with branches
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test all endpoints with branch data
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update frontend to support branch selection
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement branch transfer functionality (optional)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create branches
- [ ] Create purchase orders with branches
- [ ] Verify inventory updates correct branch
- [ ] Create customer orders
